# About Zipcodebase - Free Zip Code API
Zipcodebase is a zip code API that was founded in 2019 to solve common issues with postal code data. As we have launched geocodeapi.io, a general geocoding API for forward and reverse geocoding, we learned from our customers, that that there was a specific need for zip code data. Our customers were basically looking for a simple solution to do tasks: 

* calculate the distance between zip codes
* find zip codes around a given zip code
* find a major location behind a zip code
* match together a list of zip codes by their distance to each other

This was the moment we decided to launch zipcodebase.com, a feature-complete zip code API. 

The API uses keys to allow access to the API. You can register a free API key at our [developer portal](https://app.zipcodebase.com/register?plan=free). This will allow you to conduct 10,000 free searches per month. 

To provide you with the best developer experience possible, we also created a Postman collection covering all of our endpoints.
